In turn, it is the responsibility of Shell employees to report suspected breaches of the Business Principles to Shell.

The Business Principles have for many years been fundamental to how we conduct our business and living by them is crucial to our continued success.

Chief Executive Officer

# CW361444 – UZU AND CPF UPGRADE PROJECT – (CPF Upgrade Installation works)

2.0 General Description of the Project and existing facilities2.1 Introduction

The Gbaran Integrated Oil and Gas node, situated in the seasonal fresh-water swamp covers an area approximately 3,000 sq km, spread across Bayelsa, Rivers and Imo states in the eastern part of the Niger Delta. It is a major oil and gas production hub in SPDC, covering the following fields – Gbaran, Etelebou, Kolo Creek, Adibawa, Adibawa NE, Ahia, Abasere, Enwhe, Mini-Nta, Obele and Rumuekpe – in Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) 16, 17, 21, 22, 27 and 28. The geographic centre of the Gbaran node is located at Gbaran, 100 km NW of Port Harcourt and 40 km NE of Yenagoa.

The Gbaran Central Processing Facility (CPF) came on stream in year 2010 with a gas production capacity of 1.0Bscfd and liquid production capacity of 120 Mbpd. There are remote field manifold locations at Zarama, Kolocreek, Gbaran, Koroama and Epu for NAG well manifolds. The Gbaran CPF gas production capacity was debottlenecked to 1.2 Bscfd in 2013 and then 1.25 Bscfd in 2017. Current project scope includes a CPF capacity upgrade to ca 1.4 Bscfd.

Uzu is a green field, but in close proximity to Zarama, a producing field and 15km NE of Gbaran CPF. Uzu field was discovered in 1971 and located in OML 28. Uzu appraisal well was drilled from Zarama location (tagged ZARA015 well) thereby providing opportunity to utilize existing facilities and RoWs in the Zarama area.

2.2 Project Overview

SPDC JV with Shell as operator of OMLs 16, 17, 21, 22, 27 and 28 on behalf of the joint venture partners, embarked on the Gbaran Phase 3B - Uzu with CPF Upgrade project which aims to develop 815Bscf (UR) of gas and 11.5MMbbls (UR) of oil & condensate to meet SPDC’s commitment to sustain NLNG gas supply obligation and grow oil production.

The project scope includes infill drilling involving 5 NAG wells and 1 oil well, flowlines, test line and a NAG bulk line from the Uzu field to the Gbaran CPF. The facility upgrade scope at the Gbaran Central Processing Facility include installation of a 200MMscfd TEG dehydration train, ancillary units and brownfield tie-ins.

All six wells to be drilled as part of this development will be from two existing Zarama 15 and Zarama 08-11 NAG well locations. Three NAG wells will be drilled, and one existing well will be completed at Zarama 15 location. At the Zar 8-11 location, 1 NAG well and 1 Oil well will be drilled.

Extension of Zarama 15 location will be required to accommodate expansion of the existing cellar for three more wells (with provision for relief well) and a new manifold location, while free slots at Zarama 08-11 location will be used for the 1 NAG and 1 Oil well drilling. Four NAG wells will be hooked up to the new Uzu-1 manifold (adjacent to Zarama 15 well location) via 8” 1500# NAG DSS flow lines and bulk flowed via new 16” x10km 1500# CS bulkline to a new Uzu-2 manifold at the Zarama NAG manifold location.

The new NAG well at Zarama 08-11 location will be hooked up to the new Uzu-2 manifold via new 8” 1500# DSS flowline.

The Uzu NAG fluids will be evacuated via the existing 20-inch Zarama bulkline to the Koroama Slug catcher at Gbaran CPF. A connection will be provided from the new Uzu-2 manifold (at Zarama NAG manifold location) to the existing Zarama bulkline. The existing Zarama NAG wells will be evacuated to the CPF via a new 16” x 10km 1500# CS bulkline connected to the Zarama slug catcher via the LP (compression) manifold.

One oil well will also be drilled, completed and tied in to existing 16” x 17.5km Zarama Oil bulkline and 6” x 17.5km Zarama test line via new 6” 1500# CS Oil and test flowlines. The connection of the new oil and test line to the existing oil and test lines shall be via barred tees.

# 6.3 Evaluation of VARIATIONS

(c) The basis to be specified by COMPANY for the evaluation of any VARIATION will be one or more of those described in sub-article 6.2 in this SCHEDULE OF PRICES and the Bills of Approximate Quantities, except that, apart from where a lump sum basis is specified, actual quantities and time units will be used instead of estimates. Where a lump sum is agreed between the PARTIES it will not be subject to change except as a result of a further VARIATION.

# 6.4 Rates Prices and percentages

All rates, prices and percentages contained in this SCHEDULE OF PRICES and the Bills of Approximate Quantities are to apply equally to executing any VARIATION regardless of location, large or small quantities or whether it is an addition or reduction to the SCOPE. Where required, additional rates will be established on a basis consistent with the existing rates included in this SCHEDULE OF PRICES and the Bills of Approximate Quantities and such new rates will be established using one of the following methods:

- Proration of Existing Rates: The existing rates being interpolated or prorated to establish the new rates for similar work;
- Setting of New Rates: Where interpolation or prorating of existing rates is not appropriate and no similar rate can be used as a basis for establishing an additional rate, then the new rate will be established in a manner consistent with the make-up of the relevant existing rate. New rates will be developed by CONTRACTOR and agreed by COMPANY prior to such rates being used to evaluate a VARIATION. New rates when approved by COMPANY will remain valid for the remainder of the CONTRACT. In the event that COMPANY and CONTRACTOR cannot agree on any additional rate, COMPANY will proceed in accordance with sub-article 8.7 of VARIATIONS (Section IIIA)

(c) CONTRACTOR will, for work not classified as short duration work, apply the following hierarchy of control for isolation:

- (i) remove equipment from HAZARDS, or create an air gap or physical break to prevent the HAZARD from affecting people;
- (ii) isolate equipment from HAZARDS using a solid physical barrier. Blinding is the minimum isolation requirement for confined space entry and for work covered by the requirements in the Hot Work provision, of the HSSE STANDARDS; and
- (iii) move to the safe position and lock movable devices, electrical circuit breakers, and valves that isolate HAZARDS.

(d) When applying the hierarchy of control from the previous paragraph to isolate electrical equipment, CONTRACTOR will verify that electrical back-feed is not possible. When applying the hierarchy of control from the previous paragraph for valves, two valves must be closed and a drain opened between them (double block and bleed), or if a single valve is used, verify that it provides isolation, and provide at least one additional control (such as personal protective equipment). Where the single valve is the barrier to an acute toxic substance, a pressure greater than four bar, a material above its flash point or a material above 60°C (Celsius), this method of control can only be used to install a blind.

(e) For work not classified as short duration work and where all the elements in the hierarchy of control cannot be applied, CONTRACTOR will:

- (i) include a requirement to undertake a risk assessment to identify alternative controls;
- (ii) after a risk assessment is in place, approve any variance from the hierarchy of control or delegate the authority for approval of the variance.
- (iii) when delegating the authority to approve a variance, verify that the delegate obtains additional approval of another independent, authorised person.
- (iv) approve single-valve process isolations only when it is proven that the system is depressurized prior to intrusive work being performed (zero energy check).

(f) Before executing short duration work, CONTRACTOR will verify that a:

- (i) zero-energy check has been performed and a zero energy condition is confirmed;
- (ii) single operating and/or maintenance team is involved (i.e. no handover or shift change to a new team is involved, and the WORKSITE is not left unattended) while the system is isolated; and
- (iii) documented and approved risk assessment shows single valve process isolation to be a safe alternative to full application of the hierarchy of control.

(g) For all work covered by Safe Isolation Lock Out Tag Out, CONTRACTOR will apply a PERMIT TO WORK and an isolation list to manage work and to identify every point where locks and tags are to be applied.

(h) CONTRACTOR will manage isolation, placement, and removal of locks and tags by:

(iii) installing blinds or placing locks and completed tags at isolation points to make it clear to anyone who wants to use or work on the equipment that it is isolated;

(iv) using locks and tags that are readily identifiable as being used only for isolation, identifying the person who placed the lock and tag and the time the tag was placed, and ensuring the locks and tags are weatherproof and secure enough to prevent unauthorised or inadvertent removal;

(v) verifying that all isolation valves remain in full sight and are under the exclusive management of the team installing the blinds when using isolation tags without locks to install blinds.

(vi) verifying that the equipment is properly isolated and that no stored energy or HAZARDS remain;

(vii) when the work is complete, telling affected people about the plans to remove isolation and put equipment back in service;

(viii) verifying that each person removes their individual lock, and the individuals authorised remove the tags following an agreed plan; and

(ix) telling affected people what equipment has been put back in service.

(i) CONTRACTOR will ensure that CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL engaged in Safe Isolation - Lock Out Tag Out:

(i) always retain keys used for isolation in their sole possession unless otherwise required by a group lock out tag out procedure;

(ii) do not remove a lock or tag placed by someone else unless authorised to do so by the Lock Out Tag Out procedure;

(iii) do not operate or energise a device that is locked or tagged;

(iv) advise the person named on the tag, or the supervisor, of any tag that has fallen off, or has been misplaced; and

(v) remove and return tags as specified by the Lock Out Tag Out procedure.

Personal Protective Equipment

(a) CONTRACTOR will apply the following hierarchy of control to manage personal protective equipment use:

(i) eliminate the HAZARD or exposure;

---page_338---

# All gross payments (inclusive of salaries, allowances, tax, etc.) to Nigerian citizens employed in the direct performance and indirect support of the WORK and for the period of the WORK, shall be deemed to be 100% Nigerian Content.

# All expenses reimbursements or payments (exclusive of salary, allowances, tax, etc. but inclusive of hotel bills, transport allowances e.t.c. expended in-country) made on behalf of non-Nigerian citizens employed in the direct performance and indirect support of the WORK and for the period of the WORK, shall be deemed to be 20% of the hourly rate of such employees and as such, only that proportion of the hourly rate shall be included in the determination of Nigerian Content.

# For comparative and statistical purposes, the payments shall be split between payments to Managerial/Professional staff and Artisan/Junior staff.

# In recognition of the need to incur costs in executing the training and development programmes in the Nigerian Content development plan, all personnel costs related to training, capability development and transfer of technology programmes for Nigerian manpower on training in-country shall be regarded as 100% Nigerian content. Where training is carried out abroad, 20% of related personnel costs shall be taken as Nigerian Content. No foreign costs like base salaries of expatriates should be considered as part of the Nigerian content component, however expenses of the expatriate in-country can be considered as Nigerian Content.

# The base salaries of Nigerians who work with project team outside the country are to be calculated as Nigerian Content, while the living expenses abroad are not Nigerian Content.

# Materials (related to goods & services provided).

This covers materials procured for use either as a direct input in fabrication, construction, installation and commissioning or indirectly such as software etc.

Where the product is manufactured in Nigeria using Nigerian raw materials, then the Nigerian content is 100% of the cost.

In all other instances where the product or its components are not of Nigerian origin, then the Nigerian content is simply the added value to the product by Nigerians (working in a company registered and domiciled in Nigeria) in the course of assembly, product finishing and delivery.

---page_339---

# 340

For consistency and ease of calculation in cases where the value added cannot be easily and objectively determined, this shall be regarded as the price of the product as charged to the COMPANY less the foreign elements of the costs made up of:

- Cost of importing raw materials including Insurance & Freight;
- Import duties plus other clearing costs such as taxes & levies (NPA, ECOWAS fund, etc.)
- Any other costs incurred in the course of importation.

For items purchased from the Nigerian market where the determination of the above costs will be laborious and time consuming, the following percentages for Nigerian Content shall be assumed:

| Description                                                                                                          | % Nigerian Content |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Imported (sourced directly from foreign company)                                                                     | 0                  |
| Imported (but sourced through local company)                                                                         | 5                  |
| Assembly done in Nigeria                                                                                             | 20                 |
| Manufacturing done in Nigeria with over 60% of input materials being imported or less than 40% local input materials | 40                 |
| Manufacturing done in Nigeria with over 60% of the input materials being local materials                             | 100                |

Also, please note that where services are procured through a local sub-contractor, a mark-up of 5% on sub-contracted services would be awarded as Nigerian content.

# 4.3 Capital Assets/Equipment

A prime objective of Nigerian Content development is to encourage increased investment in manufacturing & fabrication facilities.

Initial Company……………………….. Initial Contractor……………………….

INVITATION TO TENDER FOR EPC FOR GBARAN PHASE 3B - UZU WITH CPF UPGRADE- PKG 1 CPF UPGRADE_CW361444

---page_340---

# This item refers to costs incurred in the acquisition/development of capital assets and infrastructure in Nigeria as it relates to the delivery/execution of a project, the provision of a service or the manufacture of components for direct input into a project.

The goal is to recognise the contribution of the Asset/Equipment to Nigerian Content in monetary terms. This will be the total cost of the Asset/Equipment less the taxes and import duties paid2 subject to the next paragraph.

As Capital assets by their nature are of a permanent nature and expected to have a useful life of several years the following guide is applicable:

100% of the cost where the useful life of the Capital Asset is less than the contract duration or the asset has a zero or negligible realisable value at the end of the contract.In all other cases i.e. where the asset life is longer than the contract duration, the value to be considered for each contract shall be apportioned on the basis of the time spent on the contract multiplied by the cost spread over the useful life of the asset –(cost/asset life (months) X number of months spent on contract)

Where an equipment is leased, the Nigerian content will depend on the category of the owner/lessor companies weighted as follows: Wholly Indigenous - 100%; Majority Nigerian Shareholding Company - 75%; Alliance or Joint Venture between an Indigenous & a foreign company - 50%; Majority Foreign Shareholding Company - 25% and; Foreign Company - 5%.

# Services/Contracts (Including Sub Contracting)

All services rendered in Nigeria by Nigerians funded in Naira shall be deemed 100% Nigerian Content.

For sub-contracts, Sub-Contractors shall be expected to provide information at the same level of detail as the Main Contractor (which shall include details of Nigerian content in labour, materials, equipment and sub services) and the total Nigerian content value shall then be included here.

Statutory payments made to Nigerian governmental organizations for permits, licences and levies in order to execute the contract shall not be taken as Nigerian content.

2 This is for consistency with the method used for materials and the overall guideline that taxes & duties are expressly excluded from the computation of Nigerian content.

---page_341---

# 4.5 Reporting

Measurements shall be reported by means of Nigerian Content Monitoring Form attached as Appendices V.1. CONTRACTOR shall include a preliminary Nigerian Content Plan in the Technical Tender package. The plan shall be finalized with the COMPANY before contract is awarded and a copy submitted to COMPANY.

The Plan shall be reviewed and agreed during the Kick-Off meeting and shall form part of the elements of the Quarterly Business Performance Review (BPR).

After contract award, the CONTRACTOR shall be required to submit monthly reports, which shall also include details of deviations from the agreed Nigerian Content Plan to the Shell Authorised Representative. The CONTRACTOR shall notify the COMPANY in writing where deviations from the agreed Nigerian Content Plan are observed.

At the end of the contract, the CONTRACTOR shall submit a final Nigerian Content report to the Shell Authorised Representative, which shall be evaluated to rank CONTRACTOR’s performance as either below target, threshold, on target or above target.

The COMPANY shall officially recognize CONTRACTORS that consistently perform above target and where specific contractors consistently default, the COMPANY shall flag this and penalized in accordance with the provisions of the CONTRACT.

CONTRACTOR’s must familiarise themselves and comply with reporting requirements in the Nigerian Oil & Gas Industry Content Development Act

unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to COMPANY that CONTRACTOR will perform and observe the OBLIGATIONS, and comply with the terms and conditions, of the CONTRACT in all respects as if GUARANTOR were the sole principal obligor and not merely GUARANTOR; and agrees to INDEMNIFY COMPANY GROUP for LIABILITIES in respect of any failure by CONTRACTOR to perform or comply with any OBLIGATION.

Limitation

In connection with the undertakings in the preceding sub-article, GUARANTOR is entitled to the benefit of any limitation or exclusion of liability that would be available to CONTRACTOR under the CONTRACT. However, this proviso does not apply where the failure to perform is due to the OBLIGATIONS being or becoming void, voidable, unenforceable, or illegal.

# NO RELEASE OF LIABILITY

As between GUARANTOR and COMPANY (but without affecting any obligations of CONTRACTOR), GUARANTOR remains liable under this GUARANTEE as sole primary obligor and not merely as a surety.

The liability of the GUARANTOR is not discharged or affected by:

- any time, indulgence, waiver, or consent given to CONTRACTOR or any other PERSON;
- any amendment to or variation of SCOPE in the CONTRACT or to any security or other guarantee or indemnity;
- the making or absence of any demand on CONTRACTOR or any other PERSON for payment;
- the enforcement or absence of enforcement of CONTRACT or of any security, right of action, or other guarantee, or indemnity;
- the release of any such security, right of action, guarantee, or indemnity
- Any INSOLVENCY EVENT, liquidation, dissolution, amalgamation, reconstruction, or reorganisation of CONTRACTOR or any other PERSON;
- the illegibility, invalidity, or unenforceability, or any defect in any provision of the CONTRACT or any of CONTRACTOR’s OBLIGATIONS;
- any failure, defect, or unenforceability of any OBLIGATION or any term or condition of the CONTRACT;
- any disability or incapacity of CONTRACTOR;
- the fraud of CONTRACTOR;
- the non-existence of any matter which GUARANTOR considers a condition precedent (and if any such matter is considered to be a condition precedent, it is expressly waived);
- the lack of authority of any director of CONTRACTOR or of any other PERSON acting or purporting to act on behalf of CONTRACTOR with the express or implied authority of CONTRACTOR; or
- any other act, event, or omission which might operate to discharge, impair, or otherwise affect any of GUARANTOR’S obligations or liabilities under this GUARANTEE or any rights, remedies or powers conferred on COMPANY under the CONTRACT.

GUARANTOR waives any rights to require COMPANY, before proceeding against GUARANTOR, to pursue first any remedy which COMPANY may have against CONTRACTOR.

GUARANTOR covenants with COMPANY that if CONTRACTOR should go into liquidation, due to an INSOLVENCY EVENT or other reason, and the liquidators disclaim the CONTRACT, then the liability of the GUARANTOR under this GUARANTEE remains in full effect.

# CONTINUING GUARANTEE

This GUARANTEE is a continuing security and is not discharged by the performance of any particular OBLIGATION and remains in full effect until all OBLIGATIONS are performed in full.

# DEALINGS WITH CONTRACTOR

Before enforcing this GUARANTEE in respect of any OBLIGATION, COMPANY will demand performance by CONTRACTOR. But COMPANY is not obliged to seek to enforce any remedy it may have under the CONTRACT or at law, initiate any legal proceedings, obtain any judgment, or make or file any claim in the bankruptcy, dissolution, or winding up of CONTRACTOR (or equivalent proceedings in any other jurisdiction).

# Appendix 1 – Technical and Organisational Measures

1. Technical and Organisational Measures

PROCESSING of PERSONAL DATA must take place on data processing systems for which technical and organizational measures for protecting PERSONAL DATA have been implemented. In this context, PROCESSOR assures COMPANY that it will take all measures required for the processing of the PERSONAL DATA on the data processing systems of PROCESSOR in accordance with the APPLICABLE DATA PROTECTION LAWS and requirements, provided that, having regard to the state of technological development and the cost of implementing any measures, the measures must ensure a level of security appropriate to the harm that might result from unauthorised or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage and the nature of the PERSONAL DATA to be protected.

PROCESSOR will implement measures designed to:

- deny unauthorised persons access to data-processing equipment used for processing PERSONAL DATA (equipment access control);
- prevent the unauthorised reading, copying, modification or removal of data media (data media control);
- prevent the unauthorised input of PERSONAL DATA and the unauthorised inspection, modification or deletion of stored PERSONAL DATA (storage control);
- prevent the use of automated data-processing systems by unauthorised persons using data communication equipment (user control);
- ensure that persons authorised to use an automated data-processing system only have access to the PERSONAL DATA covered by their access authorisation (data access control);
- ensure that it is possible to verify and establish to which individuals PERSONAL DATA have been or may be transmitted or made available using data communication equipment (communication control);
- ensure that it is subsequently possible to verify and establish which PERSONAL DATA have been put into automated data-processing systems and when and by whom the input was made (input control);
- prevent the unauthorised reading, copying, modification or deletion of PERSONAL DATA during transfers of those data or during transportation of data media (transport control);
- ensure that installed systems may, in case of interruption, be restored (recovery);
- ensure that the functions of the system perform, that the appearance of faults in the functions is reported (reliability) and that stored PERSONAL DATA cannot be corrupted by means of a malfunctioning of the system (integrity).

On request, PROCESSOR will provide COMPANY GROUP with a comprehensive, up-to-date data protection and security plan for the data processing under the terms of this DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT.

No person will be appointed by PROCESSOR to process the PERSONAL DATA unless that person: (i) is competent and qualified to perform the specific tasks assigned to him PROCESSOR; (ii) has been authorized by PROCESSOR; and (iii) has been fully instructed by PROCESSOR in the procedures and statutory regulations relevant to the performance of the obligations of PROCESSOR under this DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT, in particular the limited purpose of the data PROCESSING.

It is prohibited to make copies of any PERSONAL DATA transmitted by COMPANY to PROCESSOR, provided, however, that PROCESSOR may retain copies of PERSONAL DATA provided to it under a related contract in its servers for backup and archive purposes until the completion of the SCOPE under the CONTRACT.
